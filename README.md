  <p align='center'>A technology kit for universal react applications.</p>
</p>

## About

This technology kit contains all the build tooling and configuration you need to kick off your next universal React project, whilst containing a minimal "project" set up allowing you to make your own architecture decisions (Redux/MobX etc).

## Features

  - 😎 Progressive Web Application ready, with offline support, via a Service Worker.
  - 🐘 Long term browser caching of assets with automated cache invalidation.
  - 📦 All source is bundled using Webpack v2.
  - 🚀 Full ES2017+ support - use the exact same JS syntax across the entire project. No more folder context switching! We also only use syntax that is later in the TC39 process.
  - 🔧 Centralised application configuration with helpers to avoid boilerplate in your code. Also has support for environment specific configuration files.
  - 🔥 Extreme live development - hot reloading of ALL changes to client/server source, with auto development server restarts when your application configuration changes.  All this with a high level of error tolerance and verbose logging to the console.
  - 🤖 Optimised Webpack builds via HappyPack and an auto generated Vendor DLL for smooth development experiences.
  - 🍃 Tree-shaking, courtesy of Webpack.
  - 🏜 Asset bundling support. e.g. images/fonts.
  - 🎛 Preconfigured to support development and optimised production builds.
  - 👼 Airbnb's ESlint configuration.

Redux/MobX, data persistence, modern styling frameworks and all the other bells and whistles have been explicitly excluded from this starter kit.  It's up to you to decide what technologies you would like to add to your own implementation based upon your own needs.
